			<p> The public and private sectors struggle with creating unified emergency management plans because they lack 
				efficient research, communication and collaboration capabilities. 
				<a href="http://www.integrity.us.com/" target="_blank">Integrity Consulting</a>,
				a Maryland-based consulting firm, identified this opportunity and conceptualized a web platform that will 
				address the needs of the emergency management planning 	community.</p>
				<p>I worked with Integrity Consulting and three other undergraduate students from the 
				<a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/quest/" target="_blank">QUEST Honors program</a>
				to bring Integrity Consulting's concept of an integrated web platform to life by creating its user interface
				and documenting its capabilities.</p>
				<p>Name of organisation changed to EMP for confidentiality reasons.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Semi-Structured Interviews:</b> Conducted interviews with members of EMP to understand the workflow process
					of the organization</li>
				<li><b>Comparative Analysis:</b> Researched other web platforms that offered services to similar organizations</li>
				<li><b>Ideation/Sketches</b> Created sketches in order to present different forms of information architecture
					 (watch the spelling of that) for the web platform. Selected best features after reviewing with client (Integrity Consulting) </li>	
				<li><b>Prototyping:</b> Created 12 mock-ups in PowerPoint for high-level capabilities, and made modifications
					based on feedback from client</li>

			<div class="portfolioText">
			<p>Based on our design sessions we learned some important lessons:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Created a set of 12 mock-ups to showcase some high level features of the web platform</li>
				<li>Created a requirements matrix to list all the features the platform must have, in order of priority</li>
				<li>Created a process matrix that would apply to different parts of EMP</li>
			
			<p>Findings of this project were presented at the 
				<a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/quest/businesspartners/SeniorConf.aspx target="_blank"></a>QUEST Senior Conference</a>
				in December 2010. It was also presented to Integrity Consulting and the organization they were working with.</p>
