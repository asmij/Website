			<p> The public and private sectors struggle with creating unified emergency management plans because they lack 
				efficient research, communication and collaboration capabilities. Integrity Consulting identified this 
				opportunity and conceptualized a web platform that will address the needs of the emergency management planning 
				community.</p>
				<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.integrity.us.com/" target="_blank">Integrity Consulting</a>,
				a Maryland-based consulting firm, and three other undergraduate students from the 
				<a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/quest/" target="_blank">QUEST Honors program</a>
				to bring Integrity Consulting's concept of an integrated web platform to life by creating its user interface
				and documenting its capabilities.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Semi-Structured Interviews:</b> Conducted interviews with a few members of EMP to understand how workflow process
					of the organisation</li>
				<li><b>Comparative Analysis:</b> Researched other web platforms that offered services to similar organisation</li>
				<li><b>Ideation/Sketches</b> Created sketches of multiple ways to visualize different forms of information archintecture
					for the web platform. Selected best features after reviewing with client (Integrity Consulting) </li>	
				<li><b>Prototyping:</b> Created 12 mock ups in PowerPoint for higher level capabilities and presented them to client 
					and made modifications based on feedback</li>

			<div class="portfolioText">
			<p>Based on our design sessions we learned some important lessons:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Created a set of 12 mock ups to showcase some high level features of the web platform</li>
				<li>Created a requirements matrix to list out all the features in order or priority that the platform must have</li>
				<li>Created a process matrix that would apply to different parts of EMP</li>
			
			<p>Findings of this project were presented at the 
				<a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/quest/businesspartners/SeniorConf.aspx target="_blank"></a>QUEST Senior Conference</a>
				in December 2010. It was also presented to Integrity Consulting and the organization they were working with.</p>
