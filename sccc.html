			<p><a href="http://www.seattlecentral.org/" target="_blank">Seattle Central Community College (SCCC)</a>, located in Capitol Hill, Seattle, 
				will be doing a website redesign in the coming two years. I worked with three other Masters students from the HCDE department at UW to
				conduct a usability study on the current website. Our goal was to investigate how students were using the website and what design 
				implementations would make the information organization and navigation more usable.  </p>

			<div class="portfolioText">
			<ul>
				<li><b>Survey and Analysis:</b> Carried out a survey to identify major problem areas and areas of interest on the website.</li>
				<li><b>Task Creation:</b> Created tasks related to the previously identified areas to study students' interactions and gain their
					feedback. </li>
				<li><b>Usability Test:</b> Conducted seven test sessions with students who were in their first quarter at SCCC. Sessions consisted of 
					the participants completing the tasks and then a de-brief session and a post-test questionnaire where we gained more insight on 
					how the participants normally used the website. Sessions were recorded using Camtasia.</li>	
				<li><b>Data Analysis:</b> Analysed data from post-test questionnaire along with metrics like 'task complete success rate', 
					and 'task efficiency'.</li>

			<div class="portfolioText">
			<p>We based our findings on three sources: observing tasks and the results, the post-test questionnaire, 
				and the de-briefing session. We identified 14 findings and grouped them into 4 categories. For each finding,
				we created a problem statement, and a specific recommendation. In addition, for each problem statement we also 
				also evaluted it according to three dimensions - Scope, Severity, and Complexity. </p>
			<br></br>
			<p>We provided recommendations for each of these four areas to SCCC. In addition, we also recommended design changes for further
				usability tests in order to focus on the four identified areas.</p>
