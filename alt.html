			<p>There is a huge scope of opportunity for tablets to revolutionise the magazine reading
				experience.	I worked with <a href="http://generalui.com">General UI</a>, a Seattle based developer, 
				and three other Masters studetns from the Human Centered Design department at the UW to design the v2 of 
				the <a href="http://www.mamalode.com"></a>Mamalode's iPad app. Mamalode is a magazine
				for mothers which seeks to provide networking and support for mothers. </p>

			<div class="portfolioText">
			<ul>
				<li><b>Semi-Structured Interviews:</b> We conducted 5 one hour long interviews regarding their 
					views on motherhood, personal goals, reading habits, and use of technology</li>
				<li><b>Social Network Mapping:</b> Asked participants to  visually explain their social network and 
					how they are linked</li>
				<li><b>Personas:</b> After analysis, three personas (primary, secondary, anti) were created to represent users</li>	
				<li><b>Ideation:</b> Brainstormed a list of ideas using affinity diagrams</li>
				<li><b>Prototyping:</b> Created a paper prototype (for internal use), and a hi-fi prototype using HTML/CSS/jquery to 
					test out our top three ideas from brainstorming</li>
				<li><b>Usability Testing:</b> We conducted three test sessions where users interacted with the hi-fi prototype on the
					iPad. We made some modifications based on the results from these sessions</li>						
			</ul>

			<h3>Results</h3>

			</div>
		
			<div class="portfolioText">
			<p>Based on our findings we incorporated the following design decisions into our hi-fi prototype:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Created an immersive reading experience that would focus on magazine content</li>
				<li>Incorporated at-a-glance features that would support mother's opportunistic reading habits</li>
				<li>Incorporated relevant sharing features as mothers share information very selectively</li>									
			</ul>
			
			<p>Further recommendations have been submitted to General UI, and they are currently working with Mamalode to
				develop the next phase of the app.</p>
